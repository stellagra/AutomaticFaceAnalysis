## Datasets
unsorted list coming. Below you find some tables, in an attempt to sort the information. 

- [YouTube Facial Palsy (YFP) Database](https://sites.google.com/view/yfp-database#h.p_DaUvW9mE7B_g) (2018): 32 videos of 21 patients from YouTube, and  a few patients have multiple videos. available upon request
- [Aff-Wild2](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/aff-wild2/) (2019): The Aff-Wild2 is annotated in a per frame basis for the seven basic expressions (i.e., happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, sadness and the neutral state), twelve action units (AUs 1,2,4,6,7,10,12,15,23,24,25, 26) and valence and arousal. In total Aff-Wild2 consists of 564 videos of around 2.8M frames with 554 subjects (326 of which are male and 228 female). All videos have been annotated in terms of valence and arousal. 546 videos of around 2.6M frames have been annotated in terms of the basic expressions. 541 videos of around 2.6M frames have been annotated in terms of action units. Aff-Wild2 displayes a big diversity in terms of subjects' ages, ethnicities and nationalities; it has also great variations and diversities of environments. Available upon request for academia and industry
